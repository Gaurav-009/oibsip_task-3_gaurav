Task-3_ATM Interface

I undertook a project where I built an ATM Interface program that provides ATM functionalities. It facilitates: 
- Display and selection of options from a menu, 
- Prompting the user for input, 
- Updating your account balance based on user input. 

Overall this project has enhanced my java programming skills including working with classes, objects and methods.
